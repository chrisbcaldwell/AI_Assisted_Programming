# AI_Assisted_Programming
## MSDS 431 Week 5 Assignment: An Exercise in AI-Assisted Programming

### Assignment Specifications
Return to an earlier assignment in the course: [Go for Statistics](https://github.com/chrisbcaldwell/OLS_Comparison). Recall that this assignment drew on data for the Anscombe Quartet.
* AI-assisted programming. Looking over your repository for Go for Statistics, consider the possibilities of revising your original code with the assistance of a product like GitHub Copilot.
* AI-generated code. Select an LLM-based service or agent such as ChatGPT or Gemini 2.0 Flash. See if you can get your selected LLM agent to generate Go code for Go for Statistics. Provide a step-by-step review of your work. Try various prompts. Build a conversation with the LLM agent. Tailor the conversation to the specific needs of the programming assignment. In your repository for this assignment, include a plain text file of your complete conversation with the LLM agent.  Ensure that your GitHub repository includes dialogs of your conversations with LLM-based services or agents or links to the dialogs. Dialog files should be presented as plain text or portable document format (pdf) files (not MSWord docx files).
* Drawing on the methods above, share as much actual Go code as possible, recognizing that the code may be incomplete or invalid. In the README.md file, refer to the repository file(s) for the code and describe how it was obtained.
* As part of the README.md file, summarize your experiences. What are the possibilities for reducing programming workload?
* As part of the README.md file, also list the training materials that you used, providing the URLs and noting their usefulness in completing the assignment. Your recommendations will be noted and could influence future versions of this assignment.
